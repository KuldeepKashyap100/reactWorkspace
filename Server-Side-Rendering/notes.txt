1. synonyms -> Isomorphic, Universal, SSR
    -> these are all different words meaning the exact same thing.

2. SSR
    -> client rendering -> server sends data to client and client renders HTML.
    -> server rendering -> server renders HTML and send this HTML to client.

3. Benefits of SSR:
    -> Faster load times
        If we are running pretty large application or that will grow very large,
        rendering on server will have performance improvements in terms of response time of your App.
        consider this fact, the browser on which your application renders the application is 
        impacted by the machine it runs on. Therefore, if people are looking at your application
        on older hardware such as an old phone laptop they will see a difference in performance
        to those running your hardware. however, by rendering the application in the server
        you control the performance of render.
    -> Improved SEO
        Additionally if you are concerned if your site or application gets found in the
        top results of google that might be the second benefit of rendering an application
        on the server.
        JavaScript doesn't play well with search engines and unfortunately when google for instance
        sends it bots to index your pages and it sees it javascript not HTML
        Over the past few years the situation has improved but you are better positioned to be 
        indexed properly if what that bot sees is HTML.
